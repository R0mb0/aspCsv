# aspXLS 1.0

A classic ASP Excel writer that currently supports building and writing CSV, TSV (tab separated values)
and HTML outputing, including a pretty print for HTML.

There are plans of writing to XLS and XLSX formats in a near future and reading capabilities for each
of the supported file formats: CSV, TSV, XLS and XLSX.

## Easy to use

Instantiate the class:

    set xls = new aspExl

Add the header/titles for your structure:
	
    ' Add a header: setHeader(x, value)
    xls.setHeader 0, "id"
    xls.setHeader 1, "description"
    xls.setHeader 2, "createdAt"
    
Add some data:

    ' Add the first data row: setValue(x, y, value)
    xls.setValue 0, 0, 1
    xls.setValue 1, 0, "obj 1"
    xls.setValue 2, 0, date()
    
    ' Add a range of values at once: setRange(x, y, valuesArray)
    xls.setRange 0, 2, Array(2, "obj 2", #11/25/2012#)
   
 
**Easy for outputing:**
	
Output the data in string formatted values:
	
    outputCSV = xls.toCSV()
    outputTSV = xls.toTabSeparated()
    
    outputHTML = xls.toHtmlTable()
    
    xls.prettyPrintHTML = true
    outputPrettyHTML = xls.toHtmlTable()
    

Or write it directly to a file:

	' Write the output to a file: writeToFile(filePath, format)
	xls.writeToFile("c:\mydata.csv", ASPXLS_CSV)
	
The format flags supported are:
	
	ASPXLS_CSV = 1	' CSV format
	ASPXLS_TSV = 2	' Tab separeted format
    ASPXLS_HTML = 3	' HTML table format
